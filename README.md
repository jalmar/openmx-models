# A repository of OpenMx twin models
This repository contains a collection of documented twin model specifications for the OpenMx software package in R.

List of available models
- Traditional Cholesky decomposition model used to estimate heritability
- Longitudinal Cholesky decomposition model used to estimate heritability of changes (or change in heritability)
- Common pathway model used to estimate heritability on a reliable and stable component

# general instructions

To run the OpenMx twin models you need a working version of R statistical software (available for download from https://www.r-project.org) with the OpenMx structural equation modelling sofware package (available for download from https://openmx.ssri.psu.edu) installed on your computer
