# A repository of OpenMx structural equation models
This repository contains a collection of documented twin model specifications and related models for the OpenMx[1,2] software package for structural equation modelling  in R[3].

List of models currently available:
- Measurement model for obtaining a reliable and stable component and its association with other measures
- Common pathway model for estimating heritability on a reliable and stable component obtained from a measurement model

List of models to be included in future releases:
- Traditional Cholesky decomposition model used to estimate heritability of a trait
- Longitudinal Cholesky decomposition model used to estimate heritability of changes in a trait or change in heritability of the trait with age

# General instructions
To run the OpenMx twin models you need a working version of R statistical software (available for download from https://www.r-project.org) with the OpenMx structural equation modelling sofware package (available for download from https://openmx.ssri.psu.edu) installed on your computer
